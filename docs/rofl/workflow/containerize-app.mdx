description: Containerize your app inside a Docker-like container

# Containerize an App

Services are best maintained if they are run in a **controlled environment**
also known as *a container*. This includes the exact version of the operating
system, both system and user libraries, and your carefully configured service.
The image of the container is uploaded to an *OCI file server* (e.g.
[docker.io], [ghcr.io]) from where the server hosting your bot downloads it.

[docker.io]: https://docker.io
[ghcr.io]: https://docs.github.com/en/packages/working-with-a-github-packages-registry/working-with-the-container-registry

Let's have the following project consisting of two files:

```
my-bot
├── bot.py           # A python bot script
└── requirements.txt # Python dependencies
```

For containerization we will use [Docker][docker], but you can also use
alternatives such as [Podman][podman]. In fact, when your app is deployed to
a ROFL node the containers there will be orchestrated by Podman, so feel free to
use it instead for better compatibility.

## Dockerfile

Inside the project folder create a file called `Dockerfile`. This will
instruct Docker to compile a **python-based image** and add **our python bot
script on top of it**.

```dockerfile title="Dockerfile"
FROM python:alpine3.17

WORKDIR /bot
COPY ./bot.py ./requirements.txt /bot
RUN pip install -r requirements.txt

ENTRYPOINT ["python", "bot.py"]
```

## Compose

[Docker Compose][compose] orchestrates your containers. It makes sure
they are spun up in correct order, defines storage points, networking and other
functionalities. Create `compose.yaml` with the following example content:

```yaml title="compose.yaml"
services:
  python-bot:
    build: .
    image: "docker.io/YOUR_USERNAME/YOUR_PROJECT"
    platform: linux/amd64
    environment:
      - TOKEN=${TOKEN}
```

[compose]: https://docs.docker.com/reference/compose-file/

### Adjust `image:` field to fit your needs

The `image:` field(s) in `compose.yaml` above must point to a **publicly
accessible OCI registry** where your image will be downloaded from for
execution.

In your case replace the `image:` field with a fully qualified domain of the OCI
server you use followed by your username, for example:

- `docker.io/your_username/my-bot`
- `ghcr.io/your_username/my-bot`

:::warning Always specify FQDN image URL

When specifying the container image URL, make sure to use fully qualified domain
name e.g. `docker.io/ollama/ollama` and not just `ollama/ollama`.

:::

## Build and Push

Build the container image and tag it using `docker compose`:

```shell
docker compose build
```

:::tip

You can also test the compose setup locally with:

```shell
docker compose up
```

To stop it:

```shell
docker compose down
```

:::

After building and tagging the images you need to push the container images to
publicly accessible OCI registry (e.g. [docker.io], [ghcr.io]). If this is the
first time you're pushing images on your computer, you will first need to
authenticacte with:

```shell
docker login
```

Then run the following to upload the container images to the registry:

```shell
docker compose push
```

:::warning Make sure your image is public

If you're pushing the image to GitHub containers for the first time, make sure
you [configure public package visibility][ghcr-package-visibility]!

## Pin Your Image Hash

To prevent another container image being pulled inside ROFL, pin the **image
digest** inside `compose.yaml`. Fetch the `sha256:...` digest by invoking:

```shell
docker images --digests
```

Then append `@` and the digest next to the image tag in your `compose.yaml`, for
example:

```yaml
    image: "docker.io/MY_USERNAME/my-bot@sha256:9633593eb9e8395023cb0d926982602978466ec003efa189d94a34e7bea6ec0d"
```

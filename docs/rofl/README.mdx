# Build ROFL App

![ROFL diagram](images/rofl.svg)

*Runtime OFf-chain Logic (ROFL)* apps are a mechanism to augment the deterministic
on-chain backend with verifiable off-chain applications. These applications are
stateless (with support for encrypted persistent local volumes), have access to
the network and can perform expensive and/or non-deterministic computation.

ROFL apps run in *Trusted Execution Environments (TEEs)*, similar to the
on-chain confidential runtimes. This enables them to securely authenticate to
the on-chain backend which is handled transparently by the framework. Together
they allow one to implement secure decentralized oracles, bridges, AI agents and
more.

The following chapters will teach you how to build your own ROFL app with the
help of the [Oasis Runtime SDK].

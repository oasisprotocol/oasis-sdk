# Troubleshooting

## Compilation

### `The following target_feature flags must be set: +aes,+ssse3.`

You will see the following error, if the `aes` and `ssse3` compiler flags are
not enabled during compilation of your SGX and TDX-raw ROFL:

```
error: The following target_feature flags must be set: +aes,+ssse3.
--> /home/user/.cargo/registry/src/index.crates.io-6f17d22bba15001f/deoxysii-0.2.4/src/lib.rs:26:1
|
26 | compile_error!("The following target_feature flags must be set: +aes,+ssse3.");
| ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
```

We suggest that you add the following default flags to your `.cargo/config.toml`
file:

```toml
[build]
rustflags = ["-C", "target-feature=+aes,+ssse3"]
rustdocflags = ["-C", "target-feature=+aes,+ssse3"]

[test]
rustflags = ["-C", "target-feature=+aes,+ssse3"]
rustdocflags = ["-C", "target-feature=+aes,+ssse3"]
```

## Compose file

### Environment variables defined are not considered

Due to an upstream [`podman-compose` bug][podman-compose-env-var-bug] assigning
environment variables inside the compose file and using it directly in the
commands afterwards do not work:

```yaml
services:
  oracle:
    platform: linux/amd64
    environment:
      CONTRACT_ADDRESS: 0x5FbDB2315678afecb367f032d93F642f64180aa3
    entrypoint: /bin/sh -c 'python main.py $${CONTRACT_ADDRESS}'
```

The `CONTRACT_ADDRESS` in this case will be empty in ROFL. Injecting the
variable value directly inside `entrypoint` seems to be the only workaround:

```yaml
services:
  oracle:
    platform: linux/amd64
    entrypoint: /bin/sh -c 'python main.py 0x5FbDB2315678afecb367f032d93F642f64180aa3'
```

### `depends_on` is ignored

Due to an upstream [`podman-compose` bug][podman-compose-depends-on-bug] waiting
for containers to spin up in the correct order with `depends_on` directive
doesn't work. For example, this `oracle` should spin up once the `contracts`
service successfully deploys the contracts and finishes:

```yaml
services:
  contracts:
    image: "ghcr.io/foundry-rs/foundry:latest"
    platform: linux/amd64
    volumes:
      - ./contracts:/contracts
    entrypoint: /bin/sh -c 'cd contracts && forge create'

  oracle:
    platform: linux/amd64
    entrypoint: /bin/sh -c 'python main.py'
    restart: on-failure
    depends_on:
      contracts:
        condition: service_completed_successfully
```

In ROFL the `oracle` service will be started in parallel with `contracts` and
will ignore the `depends_on` directive.

There is currently no workaround for this. You will need to implement a logic
in your `oracle` service so that the service doesn't hang if the contracts are
not deployed yet, but simpyl crashes. This way, the restart mechanism of the
service will be triggered to restart `oracle` and try again.

## ROFL Proxy URL is not working

If you have exposed a port in your `compose.yaml` but the proxy URL shown
by `oasis rofl machine show` is not accessible, it is likely that your
app is using outdated artifacts.

To fix this, update to the latest Oasis CLI version, then
run `oasis rofl upgrade` in your project directory to update the
artifacts in your `rofl.yaml` file. After that, rebuild and redeploy your app:

```shell
oasis rofl build
oasis rofl update
oasis rofl deploy
```

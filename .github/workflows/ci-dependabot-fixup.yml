# This workflow runs on Dependabot PRs that update Go dependencies. The workflow
# runs the gomod-updater tool to propagate the dependency updates to all Go projets
# in the repository. This is needed due to a Dependabot limitation which
# does not support updating multiple go projects in a single PR.

  # We need pull_request_target hook since Dependabot PR's are treated as though they are from a forked repository.
  # This means that the CI configuration will be taken from the base branch (main) and not the PR branch,
  # which makes it safe(r) to give it access to secrets.
